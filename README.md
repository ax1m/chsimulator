# chsimulator

Forked from bzzzzzu/chsimulator, I added a couple command line options for more user-friendliness.

* Main simulation loop in Init.java
* First argument specifies amount of AS. If not present, user input will be asked
* By default, a hybrid build is simulated

`-a`
	Simulates an active build

`-i`
	Simulated an idle build

`-c N`
	Sets number of clicks per second to N (defaults to 10)

`-p N`
	Sets number of simulation passes to N (defaults to 1)

Hail Borb!
